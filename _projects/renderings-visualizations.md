### Pre-build and post-build renderings and photography.
This was a project done for FB Design to visualize the new headquarters for Equator Coffee, and to photograph it after construction was completed. I made the renderings from a provided Revit model.

### Pre-build renderings.
These renderings were made for CA Lentini Design to visualize the renovations to St. Hilary School. They were also developed from a Revit file.

### Realtime Unreal Engine scene.
I use Unreal Engine 4 to create small scenes and visualizations. In this project, I used Megascans assets to create photorealistic materials and foliage.
