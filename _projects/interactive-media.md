### Marin Art and Garden Center interactive map. 
This is an interactive experience that I designed and built for [the Marin Art and Garden Center](https://magc.org/) in Ross, California in the summer of 2018. The MAGC grounds contain many notable historical places, and the non-profit was keen to showcase them to visitors. I developed a map that allows them to add locations and information with a geo and topic tagging system. 

The layout, colors, and fonts were all choosen to integrate the interactive map with MAGC's existing print and digital promotional materials.

I developed the map with the help of a survey of the grounds so that points are added with their real latitude and longitude, which are then converted to screen X/Y space to display on the interactive map. This facilitates accurately and easily adding new points to the map, as well as the possibility of future features such as a GPS enabled walkthrough. 

This project also included photographing each of the 24 points of interest at the Marin Art and Garden Center. In addition to these photos, I also created the map of the grounds from the survey.

### Sentiment analysis Chrome extension. 
This was a project I made to teach myself different techniques for sentiment analysis. I made a Chrome browser extension that allows the user to get the sentiment of the entire page or just a particular section. It provides scores for sentiment, pleasantness, and attention value according to the SenticNet 5 and AFINN-111 sentiment dictionaries. A detailed description with examples can be found [here](https://github.com/CBR0MS/sentitudeExtension/blob/master/README.md).

### Flight time prediction with machine learning.
This is a project that I developed over four days for [an HCI class](http://humanaiclass.org/) at CMU. I started with a dataset from the US Department of Transportation of data from every domestic flight since the late 80's. I spent the first two days [visualizing, cleaning, and developing a model from the data](https://github.com/CBR0MS/flightTimeModel/blob/master/Flight%20Time%20Modeling.ipynb), using Tensorflow. 

The next two days I spent designing and implementing the site. I trained the models offline and encoded them to json format, so they could be opened and used again with Tensorflow JS, making the site very lightweight. The interface is very simple, with one page for input and a second to display and visualize the results.

### A virtual game of telephone. 
This site enables a game of telephone between people on the internet. A visitor enters a new phrase, which is then distorted and added to a pile of everyone else's phrases. The visitor can then pick out a different distorted phrase and try to decipher it, in as serious or silly a manner as they see fit. A full technical description can be [found here](http://cmuems.com/2018/60212f/chromsan/09/27/chromsan-telematic/).

**_Timeframe_**: 2 Weeks

### A physical installation. 
Before entering the installation room, a group of 15 participants were asked to fill out a web-based form asking questions about the space that they live in. These answers were then compiled and projected onto the walls of an unfamiliar living space. The participants were brought into this space immediately after completing the online questionnaire and experienced their responses projected onto and scrolling up the walls.
