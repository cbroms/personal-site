excerpt: A short exercise designing a website for the 25th anniversary of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU.

I designed a microsite for the 25th anniversary of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU. The goal was to have a place for the schedule and a short description of the event to live online. I wanted to create a poster-like design based on the [HCII's logo](https://hcii.cmu.edu/sites/all/themes/custom/zen_hcii/logo.png) that could be used throughout other printed and digital materials.
