excerpt: A website developed for a weekend hackathon at CMU.

This was a project I developed with Alex Havrilla for Tartanhacks 2019, a hackathon at CMU. We wanted to create a website that could compile all of the events going on at CMU into one location. It would pull events from emails sent by clubs and student associations to email lists.

I worked on the frontend's design and implementation with Django, and Alex worked on the backend to gather emails, parse them and run some NLP.
