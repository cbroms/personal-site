This was a project I made to teach myself different techniques for sentiment analysis. I made a Chrome browser extension that allows the user to get the sentiment of the entire page or just a particular section. It provides scores for sentiment, pleasantness, and attention value according to the SenticNet 5 and AFINN-111 sentiment dictionaries. A detailed description with examples can be found [here](https://github.com/cbroms/sentitudeExtension).
