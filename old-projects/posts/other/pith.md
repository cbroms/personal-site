# Pith

Pith is an experimental online discussion space that builds on the notion of an electronic direct democracy. You can read about our latest progress on the [Pith blog](https://why.pith.is/), or get a gist of the project from the [intro presentation](https://why.pith.is/files/pith_intro.pdf).

I'm designing and developing Pith with Sydney Zheng.
