To track the progress of [Pith](/project/pith), we're posting weekly updates on a blog. In order to do this, we needed a nice simple blog. I built a small static site that takes markdown pages and renders individual post pages and an index page. Probably the fanciest part is the light/dark mode button. It can be found at [why.pith.is](https://why.pith.is), and the code can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/rainflame/pith-blog).

It's built using next.js.

# Rainflame Landing

At the same time, I designed a landing page for Rainflame, mainly as a redirect to Pith. It uses [V4.js](/project/v4js), a shader rendering library I wrote last summer. The rainflame site can be found at [rainflame.com](https://rainflame.com/) and the code can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/rainflame/rainflame-site).
