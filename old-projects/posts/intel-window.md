This is the documentation for a project I did with Kevin Thies and Vinaya Rao for the class Intelligent Environments at CMU. Our goal was to develop a prototype of an LED-illuminated window that could create a representation of the actual outdoor light conditions for spaces with no windows. We created two prototypes, one with a plastic acrylic material and another out of a salvaged glass window.
