# The Projects

The core HCI curriculum at Carnegie Mellon is a series of courses that span the entire human-centered design process, including Interaction Design, User-Centered Research and Evaluation, and Progamming User Interfaces. CMU's HCI courses are team-based with projects that range from a few days to an entire semester for a client. I took many of these courses between 2019 and 2020—here are a few of the projects from that period I think are worth highlighting.

1. [Golden Eggs (fall 2019)](#1-golden-eggs)
2. [CJ's Thingamabobs (spring 2020)](#2-construction-junctions-thingamabobs)
3. [Adopt a Tree (spring 2020)](#3-adopt-a-tree)
4. [Go Gilson (spring 2020)](#4-go-gilson)

# 1. Golden Eggs

Duration: 1.5 months

For User-Centered Research and Evaluation. The project clients were the Heinz School of Public Policy and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

_Our goal was to find innovative ways to improve the interaction between viewers and public art, to pull in more people that don't usually engage with art, and to create new connections between the public and artists._

### Process

The starting point for this project was exploring the current state of public art in Pittsburgh through analytics collected by a project through the Heinz School, research into the insitutions invloved, and then synthesis through stakeholder diagrams.

We next moved to inverviewing members of the public by hanging out around public art pieces and talking with people who passed by. We sythesized the findings from these interviews using affinity diagramming.

One clear need we identified was that people wanted to know about the people behind the art; who made it, and why? We moved to interviewing local artists to understand their experience engaging with the public; it turns out there's very little interaction.

We created storyboards and propmted Pittsburgh locals to engage with the potential directions through speed dating sessions. The winner: a gamified system that would give people a reason to explore their city through its art while learning about the people behind it.

Finally, we created a prototype of the system using 50 golden plastic Easter Eggs containing interesting tidbits of information about a piece of art downtown and placed them beside it. The result: the eggs spurred people's curiousity and the content left them wanting even more.

> “If I saw the eggs at a different art piece I would want it to be like a scavenger hunt. These eggs are so cool I would want to hold on to them and have like a collection...”

You can read about the Golden Eggs project in more detail; I've also written [an extended case study](/projects/golden-eggs).

# 2. Construction Junction's Thingamabobs

Duration: 3 weeks

For Interaction Design Studio II.

_Our goal was to research an existing company's offerings and find the opportunity to insert a new service into their ecosystem that could be built out as an app._

### Process

Our company was Pittsburgh-based [Construction Junction](https://www.cjreuse.org/), who provide a service recycling building materials and scrap and reselling them. We began by exploring the stakeholders and organizations involved and identifying each role and jobs-to-be-done. We enumerated the functions Construction Junction provides now and reversed the assumptions at each step. This led to a number of possible services, but the most promising seemed to a consultancy service for those looking to build with the many unique salvaged goods CJ provides.

We quickly defined a rough vision of the service and moved on to the design of the app, the main focus of the project. This meant thinking about the overall flow of information needed for the service to function, as well as the intent each relevant stakeholder would have at each step.

We implemented low-fidelity wireframes and found a few key issues related to providing an up-front value to keep people engaged. The solution was to rearrange the screens such that the main value proposition is kept center and all other aspects of the service stem from it.

# 3. Adopt a Tree

Duration: 3 weeks

For Interaction Design Studio II.

_Our task was to find a way to connect people to their public spaces through an IoT sensor-based solution._

### Process

How might we help citizens find personal meaning in these public spaces?

Starting with the prompt to design an IoT system that could take advantage of networked sensors, we began to explore some possible problem spaces this might address in the public sphere.

We narrowed down to _public spaces_ as an area of focus, specifically finding ways to increase people's sense of ownership over a place as a way of keeping it maintained and cared for.

Then, the first lockdowns in late March 2020 began, making the topic more pertinent for cities where people would be even more disconnected from the public spaces around them. We realized that a connection with a natural place would be an important missing element of people's lives, and thought about ways to address this.

> “As more people move to urban centers, parks are no longer seen as "nice-to-have" amenities but as "need-to-have" infrastructure that supports our social, economic and ecological health.”

We developed storyboards and engaged in speed dating to get people's quick feelings on a number of possible directions. The winner: a system that connected people to a _specific_ public part of a public place, a tree.

Next, we moved to examining potential solutions that could connect someone to a tree in an experiential way. There were two main classes of interactions we saw as most fitting for a tree: passive (the ability to see the seasons changing, colors, shadows) and active (the ability for someone to feel its texture, temperature). We settled on a physical artifact, a morphing leaf inspired by [CMU's Morphing Matter Lab](https://www.morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/) that would serve as the connection to the tree's sensor feeds.

Our final deliverable was [a short video outlining the proposed system](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15fbdN1YNqW6O4AvVo79xzHvNde9XqKBC/view?usp=sharing).

# 4. Go Gilson

Duration: 1.5 months

For Service Design. The project client was Gilson Snow.

_Our goal was to understand Gilson's product system and find pain points for stakeholders that could be addressed through the creation of a novel service._

### Process

We began by interacting with Gilson to better understand their offerings and process, as well as their own pain points and preceived places for growth. The Gilson team provided some places to start, which we then explored by interacting with snowboarders in the field.

![](/static/images/ux-19-20/survey.png)

We collected survey data and transcribed people's accounts of their experiences interacting with the brand, buying a snowboard, learning about snowboarding, and much more. We synthesized these findings and produced personas, a service blueprint, and many service propositions.

We presented and refined these potential services before reducing the poposition down to a place to foster community engagement online. Simplicity was key; the service had to provide immediate value and require nearly no effort on the part of Gilson and their small team.
