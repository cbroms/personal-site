This was a game I made to try implementing some [dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) in an environment where the purpose is to pit the user _against_ the system.

[Play it here](https://darkpatterns.rainflame.com).

Each level is themed; the first is startup-flavored.

Here's an example of a dark pattern: hiding the option for a free version of a plan below the fold so it's hidden by default and takes extra effort to find.

Another comes from the confusing and intentionally misleading heading and content language that's opposite of what you'd expect.

The second level is Amazon-themed, with the goal being to close your account.
