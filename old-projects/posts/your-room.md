Before entering the installation room, a group of 15 participants were asked to fill out a web-based form asking questions about the space that they live in. These answers were then compiled and projected onto the walls of an unfamiliar living space. The participants were brought into this space immediately after completing the online questionnaire and experienced their responses projected onto and scrolling up the walls. See [the original post](http://studio60101.weebly.com/christian-broms/inter-relationships-projection) for a more in-depth description.
