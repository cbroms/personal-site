# Pith

[Pith](https://pith.is) is an experimental space for productive online discussions. It's a platform designed from the ground up to be a comfortable, extensible place for people to talk and produce a record of their discussion.

I'm responsible for Pith's design, especially the conversational spaces. Much of my work is centered around developing the system through an iterative design process. This spring will see an increase in user research as we narrow down the design of core discussion mechanisms, in particular the non-verbal communication and turn-taking affordances.

We employ a very open design process; all of our thinking about the system has been recorded in great detail on [our blog](https://why.pith.is/) as well as [our journal for storing near-daily updates](https://futureland.tv/christian/pith).
